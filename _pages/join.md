## Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR) at Institute for Basic Science (IBS)
Our lab is a part of the [Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)](https://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/) at [Institute for Basic Science (IBS)](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do) in South Korea. The CNIR at IBS is established in 2014 and funded by Korean government to pursue a long-term research excellence ("Korean version of Max Plank Institute"). Our lab will have a full access to the CNIR’s brand-new neuroimaging [facilities and equipments](https://cnir.ibs.re.kr/_prog/equipments/?&site_dvs_cd=cnir_en&menu_dvs_cd=050101) for conducting cutting-edge research. The facilities include animal and human MRIs (3T and 7T for human, 9.4T and 15.2T for animal), EEG, TMS, psychophysiological measures, two-photon microscope, super high-resolution confocal microscope, high performance computing clusters, electronic and machine shop, histology lab, and rodent and non-human primate animal housing. Our center and the lab have a strong emphasis on promoting an open, synergetic, multi-disciplinary, and creative research environment. Therefore, you will be able to experience active discussions and collaborations with other scientists from different fields of expertise.
