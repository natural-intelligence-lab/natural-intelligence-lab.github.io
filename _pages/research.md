## Integrative approach to study principles of natural intelligence
* It is not easy to _understand_ natural intelligence. So we take multidisciplinary approach - cognitive computational neuroscience - including careful design of cool tasks, observing behaviors from both humans and non-human primates, collecting neural data with functional neuroimaging and electrophysiology, testing predictions from computational theories and models, and comparing artificial neural networks to biological data. Of course, this is going to be a daunting task, which is exactly why we need teamwork and collaborations!

## Project 1. Numerical cognition and compositionality
* In this project, we will tackle the following questions:
  * How does the brain represent ecologically relevant numerical information (e.g., number of apples) and perform computations based on those representations (compositionality)?
  * Is there a neural circuit dedicated to numerical information processing? Is it common across different modalities of quantities - number, time, and space?
  * What is the role of the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex in processing numerical information? Are they rather independent modules or parts of a big recurrent network?
  * Do humans and non-human primates share similar neural mechanisms for magnitude processing?

## Project 2. Neural basis of relational inference in posterior parietal cortex
How does the brain make inferences based on relations between objects? To tackle this question, we have collected electrophysiology data from the posterior parietal cortex while animals performed a visual search task based on object relations in collaboration with Dr. Mehrdad Jazayeri at MIT. The large-scale neural data and its dynamical-systems analysis, will shed light on how the cortical population dynamics unfold during the relational inference. We also train artificial (graph) neural networks on the relational reasoning task and “open up” to examine how similar or different biological and artificial networks are during the task. Ultimately, this project will provide an opportunity to reverse engineer natural intelligence for neuro-AI applications.

**Research questions**
* What is the neural mechanism behind behavioral biases in interval timing? (answer: curved neural manifold)
* Is there a common principle behind the bias generation between biological and artificial neural networks? (answer: yes, we observed curved manifold in both networks)
* How does the brain process multiple events that occur concurrently in time? (answer: we don’t know yet)

* Many of our behaviors exhibit biases and rely on heuristics built through prior experiences. This process has been formalized by Bayesian decision theory, which has been quite successful in explaining behaviors across many different domains. One of the domains where the behavioral biases express prominently is timing and time perception, partly owing to its high measurement noises. After being trained in visual neuroscience (e.g., studying binocular rivalry), I performed human psychophysics experiments to study long-term learning of the interval timing and applied a Bayesian modeling approach to reveal underlying computational principles. I also collected human functional MRI data while subjects are performing the interval-timing task.
